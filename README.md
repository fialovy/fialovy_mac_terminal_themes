# fialovy's favorite (non-dark) terminal themes

This repo is just a dumping ground for a few favorite macOS terminal themes I've created for work. I'm a light theme guy (sorry not sorry), so prepare thine eyes. ðŸ‘€

### "lavendris" a.k.a. what do you think 'fialovy' is even Czech for?! ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿ðŸ’œ

### "meadowsprite" a.k.a. the legal pad of your nightmares ðŸŒ¿ðŸ’š
