# fialovy's favorite (non-dark) terminal themes

This repo is just a dumping ground for a few favorite macOS terminal themes I've created for work. I'm a light theme guy (sorry not sorry), so prepare thine eyes. 👀

### "lavendris" a.k.a. what do you think 'fialovy' is even Czech for?! 🇨🇿💜

### "meadowsprite" a.k.a. the legal pad of your nightmares 🌿💚

...because do you want your terminal do destory your eyes like the sprites are destroying this bakery? OF COURSE YOU DO.
